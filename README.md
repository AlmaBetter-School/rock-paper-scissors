## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
  
### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

#### Original

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
